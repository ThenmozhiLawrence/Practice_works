<li><h3>First activity : Simulating a ball movement</h3></li>
<h4> What are we going to do in this activity ?</h4>
<p>This activity is a javascript activity which simulates a ball movement with edge detection and 2d animation.</p>

<h4>Installation :</h4> 
<p>This activity needs the installation of Visual studio code for writing code and github repo to upload it.</p>

<h4>Usage :</h4> 
<p>Once the html file is loaded in the browser, the ball starts to move. Once the edges are detected it reverses its direction and continues to move till it hits the next edge.</p>

</ol>

<h3>Roadmap : </h3>
<p>Planning to add all the activities done as part of learning in this repo and make this as a step by step future reference.</p>
